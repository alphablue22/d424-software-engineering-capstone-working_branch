D424 – Software Engineering Capstone
A full end‑to‑end software engineering project demonstrating requirements gathering, system design, backend implementation, testing, and documentation.
Overview
This capstone project represents a complete software solution built from the ground up. It includes architectural planning, backend development, data modeling, testing, and professional documentation. The project showcases your ability to deliver a full engineering lifecycle — exactly what SWE recruiters want to see.

Features
- Full software system design
- Backend implementation (Java or Python depending on your project)
- Data modeling and persistence
- Business logic and validation
- Unit testing
- Documentation of architecture, requirements, and design decisions
- Clean, maintainable codebase

Technologies Used
- Java (or Python — whichever your capstone used)
- SQL / Database layer
- OOP design
- Testing frameworks
- Git
- UML / architecture documentation

How to Run
- Clone the repository
- Open in your preferred IDE
- Configure database settings (if required)
- Build and run the application

What I Learned
- Gathering and interpreting software requirements
- Designing system architecture
- Implementing backend logic
- Writing maintainable, production‑quality code
- Testing and validating functionality
- Documenting a complete engineering project

Status
Completed as the final capstone project for a software engineering degree.
